# apple_abscission_model

This project creates a model to predict fruitlet abscission following a chemical thinner application.

The fruit growth model created by Dr. Duane Greene uses successive measurements of fruit diameter to predict abscission rate by assuming that a fruitlet growing at a rate less
than 50% of the average of the 20 fastest growing fruits measured will abscise while a fruitlet growing faster than 50% will persist. This model is available in an excel
document, the R code - build_fgm in the code folder translates this model into R. A shiny app is made to display the results of the model in the Fruit_Growth_Model folder.
